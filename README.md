# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Documentation/Walkthrough for Falcone Systems

### To see the full Final Report click on the attached ```Audit Lab Final Report v2.pdf``` located in this repository.

## Background
This audit focused on examining the Media Protection controls at Falcone Systems, specifically to check if they align with the guidelines set out in NIST SP 800-53 regarding Media Controls. 
Falcone Systems 
We structured the audit into six detailed steps, using NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2, which covers the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-federal systems and organizations, 
as our primary reference. 

We then compared and aligned the security measures at Falcone IT Systems with the Media Protection controls from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, 
ensuring that they meet the requirements for safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information.


Below are the six steps we took to undertake this audit.

<br/>

## Step 1 - Audit Preparation

In order to prepare for the audit, two questions were asked.

1. <strong>What controls were we auditing?</strong> 
  - After contacting Falcone Systems IT department, it was determined that it would be Falcone Systems’ Media Protection controls that needed to be audited based on NIST SP 800-53.
    An excel spreadsheet from NIST SP 800-171 revision 2 was used as a base template.

2. <strong>Who did we need to talk to in order to gather our audit information?</strong>
  - After communicating with the appropriate personnel from Falcone Systems, we had scheduled meetings with two key personnel from Falcone Systems:

| Job Title |	Name	| Date	| Location |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
| Director of IT | John Finnegan | 23rd February 2024 |  Falcone Systems HQ |
| Network Engineer |	Sam Cunningham |	23rd February 2024 |	Falcone Systems HQ |

All audit interview questions were prepared before the onsite interview was conducted and necessary documents such as 
Falcone IT Systems’ Standard Operating Procedure and Security Plan were requested for review before the onsite audit interview.

<br/>

 
## Step 2 - Audit Logistics

For the external audit of Falcone IT Systems, it was not feasible to be assigned a liaison officer. 
Instead, a focused 90-minute meeting was scheduled directly with key personnel—Director of IT John Finnegan and Network Engineer Sam Cunningham—at the Falcone IT Systems Headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. 

The objective was to efficiently conclude the onsite interview within 60 minutes, allowing for an additional 30 minutes if needed to cover all necessary ground.

<br/>


## Step 3 - On-site Audit (Data gathering)
 
The on-site audit interview was conducted using tailored questions derived from NIST SP 800-53 Media Controls, addressing both interviewees simultaneously. 
The primary goals of this audit phase were to:

- [x] Ensure comprehensive data collection during the interview.
- [x] Determine the implementation status of Media Protection controls.
- [x] Document evidence, noting both the provider and the nature of the evidence.
  
With the interviewees’ consent, the session was both recorded and documented through notes.

Data collection encompassed interviews, document reviews, and testing to verify active implementation of processes.

For any additional information or to address pending action items, quick follow-up communications were promptly executed via email and phone after the audit interview.

<br/>


## Step 4 - Post Audit Reconciliation (Data cleaning)

Our goal here is to ensure that we have collected all the necessary data. Any missing data must be gathered as soon as possible.
We are now starting to organize this data into the excel spreadsheet and inputting it under the following column headings.

Below is a sample.

| Data Collection |	Evidence Detail	| Findings	| 
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
| Interview |	Director of IT	| No controls in place	| 
| Tested |	Network Engineer	| Reviewed Documentation of Media Markings	| 

<br/>

Data Collection can be:
*	Interview form – can be via recorded Zoom or in-person.
*	Documentation – these are documentation provided by the interviewee.
*	Tested – a process that the organization currently uses.

Evidence Detail can be:
*	The person who provided the evidence.
*	A documented record or process.

Findings:
*	This is the information that was given by the Evidence detail. 
*	The findings here must be factually verifiable.


<br/>


## Step 5 - Analysis 

In this step, our objective is to assess the effectiveness of the security controls under audit. 

We've introduced a ```Disposition``` column with four predefined values to describe the status of each control:

- [x] Not in Place: Indicates that the security control is absent.
- [x] Not Applicable: Indicates that the security control is unnecessary or currently not relevant.
- [x] Partially Implemented: Indicates that the security control is only partially put into effect.
- [x] Fully Implemented: Indicates that the security control is fully in place and effective.
 
The Disposition value is determined objectively by evaluating the gathered data for each control. 
This assessment is conducted individually for every control included in the audit.

<br/>


## Step 6 - Reporting our Findings (Final Audit Report)

The Final Audit Report is compiled and presented. This an audit report and not a risk report. 
You can add the risk findings in the final report after a risk assessment if needed.
The final report is attched in this git repo as a pdf file ```Audit Lab Final Report v2``` 

Included in the final audit report are the following sections:

### Executive Summary 
  *	Overview: A concise overview of the audit’s objectives, scope, and main findings. Designed for high-level stakeholders.
  *	Key Findings: Highlights critical vulnerabilities or compliance issues.
  *	Recommendations Summary: Summarizes recommended actions.

### Objective & Scope
  *	Purpose of the Audit: Describes objectives and triggers of the audit.
  * Scope: Details examined systems, networks, and data.


### Audit Methodology and Standards
  * Audit Procedures: Specific procedures followed, including automated and manual checks. Listing the people the auditors interviewed.
  * What was Audited?
  * Methodology: Explains audit methods and tools.
  * Standards and Frameworks: Cybersecurity standards and frameworks used as benchmarks. This is the specific set of controls based off a framework such SP 800-171 or NIST CSF.

### Detailed Findings and Analysis
  * Security Controls Assessment: Effectiveness of existing security controls.
  * Compliance Assessment: Compliance with laws, regulations, and standards.
  *	Linking the spreadsheet so anyone can verifiably fact check.
  *	Vulnerabilities Identified: Detailed list of discovered vulnerabilities, categorized by severity.
  *	Optionally can add a High Level compliance status (e.g. Listing the top 25 controls and implementation status next to it)

### Risk Assessment (wait)
